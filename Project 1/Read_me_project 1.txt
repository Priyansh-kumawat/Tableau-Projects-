Dataset:
	- Here i have used house price dataset of kings county, Washington.
	- the dataset is in excel form and already cleaned , but you must remember that before building a dashboard data cleaning and modelling is important.
	- Columns in dataset include no. of bathrooms , no. of bedrooms, area of living, area of garden etc.
	- you can easily import data from a csv file in tableau.

Sheets:
	- Firstly i created different sheets which include various types of graphs and charts like linechart, heatmap, histogram etc.
	- You can give a particular styling to your sheet content and copy the formatting and and paste it to other sheets , this will reduce your time consumption.
	- Filters and colors option come very handy , so make good hands on them.

Dashboard:
	
	- Firstly from the left side use vertical and horizontal containers to seperate the dashboard.
	- from left side select the size of dashboard , i prefer "Generic Desktop where in range unselect the maximum size box."
	- import the sheet content from left side.
